# Real-Time Features Demo 🚀

## **How Real-Time Works on Mobile**

Here's exactly how your app will work with real-time updates:

### **1. Sales Rep Records a Sale**
```typescript
// Sales rep adds new sale on their phone
const newSale = {
  bread_type_id: "uuid-bread-type",
  quantity: 15,
  unit_price: 500,
  shift: "morning",
  recorded_by: "sales-rep-id"
};

// This triggers real-time update to all connected users
await supabase.from('sales_logs').insert(newSale);
```

### **2. Owner Dashboard Updates Instantly**
```typescript
// Owner's dashboard automatically receives the update
function OwnerDashboard() {
  const { data: sales, connectionStatus } = useRealtimeSales();
  
  // UI updates immediately when new sale is recorded
  return (
    <div>
      <ConnectionIndicator connectionStatus={connectionStatus} />
      <MetricCard 
        title="Today's Revenue" 
        value={`₦${calculateRevenue(sales)}`} // Updates in real-time
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### **3. Manager Gets Instant Production Updates**
```typescript
// When production batch status changes
function ManagerDashboard() {
  const { data: production, connectionStatus } = useRealtimeProduction();
  
  return (
    <ProductionBatches 
      batches={production} // Live updates without refresh
      connectionStatus={connectionStatus}
    />
  );
}
```

## **Mobile Network Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Perfect Connection** 📶📶📶📶
```typescript
// Real-time updates work instantly
User Action: Records sale at 10:15 AM
Mobile App: Shows "Connected" status
Owner Dashboard: Updates immediately 
Manager Dashboard: Sees new data instantly
Result: ✅ Perfect synchronization
```

### **Scenario 2: Weak Network** 📶📶⚫⚫
```typescript
// App handles gracefully
User Action: Records sale
Mobile App: Shows "Connecting..." status
System: Queues the data, retries automatically
Connection Restored: Data syncs immediately
Result: ✅ No data loss, automatic recovery
```

### **Scenario 3: No Network** ⚫⚫⚫⚫
```typescript
// Offline-first approach
User Action: Records sale
Mobile App: Shows "Offline" indicator
System: Stores data locally in browser
User: Can continue working normally
Network Returns: All queued data syncs automatically
Result: ✅ Uninterrupted workflow
```

### **Scenario 4: Network Reconnection** 📶📶📶📶
```typescript
// Smart reconnection
Event: WiFi comes back after 30 minutes
Mobile App: Shows "Syncing..." status
System: Uploads all offline data
Dashboard: Updates with all missed activity
Notification: "Welcome back! Synced 12 items"
Result: ✅ Complete data integrity
```

```

**8:00 AM - Sales Start**
```typescript
// Sales rep opens the store
- Customer buys 5 white bread
- Records sale: "5 × ₦500 = ₦2,500"
- Owner sees: "First sale of the day! ₦2,500"

# HomeBake Production Roadmap üöÄ

## Current Status: üü° MVP READY
**What we have**: Beautiful, functional dashboards with role-based access
**What we need**: Real-time features, offline support, and production hardening

---

## PHASE 3: REAL-TIME & OFFLINE FEATURES (Critical for Mobile)

### 3.1 Real-Time Subscriptions ‚ö°
**Priority: HIGH** - Essential for bakery operations

```typescript
// Implement real-time dashboard updates
- Sales: Live updates when new sales are recorded
- Production: Real-time batch status changes
- Inventory: Instant low-stock alerts
- Staff: Live online/offline status
```

**Implementation Plan:**
- [ ] Supabase real-time subscriptions for each dashboard
- [ ] Optimistic updates for better UX
- [ ] Connection status indicators
- [ ] Automatic reconnection on network restore

### 3.2 Offline Support üì±
**Priority: HIGH** - Bakeries need reliability

```typescript
// Progressive Web App with offline-first approach
- Cache critical data for offline viewing
- Queue actions when offline (sales, production logs)
- Background sync when connection restored
- Offline indicators and graceful degradation
```

**Implementation Plan:**
- [ ] Enhanced service worker with background sync
- [ ] IndexedDB for offline data storage
- [ ] Offline queue for user actions
- [ ] Conflict resolution for sync

### 3.3 Push Notifications üîî
**Priority: MEDIUM** - Keep teams informed

```typescript
// Smart notifications for critical events
- Low stock alerts for managers
- Target alerts for sales reps
- Production delays for owners
- Shift reminders for all staff
```

---

## PHASE 4: PERFORMANCE & MONITORING (Production Hardening)

### 4.1 Performance Optimization ‚ö°
**Priority: HIGH** - Mobile performance is critical

```typescript
// Bundle optimization and lazy loading
- Code splitting for dashboard components
- Image optimization for mobile
- Lazy loading for non-critical features
- Progressive enhancement
```

**Metrics to Achieve:**
- [ ] First Contentful Paint < 1.5s
- [ ] Largest Contentful Paint < 2.5s
- [ ] Cumulative Layout Shift < 0.1
- [ ] First Input Delay < 100ms

### 4.2 Error Monitoring & Analytics üìä
**Priority: HIGH** - Know what's happening in production

```typescript
// Production monitoring stack
- Error tracking (Sentry or similar)
- Performance monitoring (Web Vitals)
- User analytics (privacy-focused)
- Custom business metrics
```

**Implementation Plan:**
- [ ] Error boundary with error reporting
- [ ] Performance monitoring setup
- [ ] Custom analytics for business metrics
- [ ] Health check endpoints

### 4.3 Security Hardening üîê
**Priority: HIGH** - Protect business data

```typescript
// Enterprise-grade security
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- CSRF tokens
```

---

## PHASE 5: ADVANCED FEATURES (World-Class Differentiation)

### 5.1 Advanced Analytics üìà
**Priority: MEDIUM** - Business intelligence

```typescript
// Smart insights and predictions
- Sales forecasting based on historical data
- Optimal production scheduling
- Customer behavior analysis
- Profitability analysis by bread type
```

### 5.2 Multi-Location Support üè™
**Priority: LOW** - Scale to multiple bakeries

```typescript
// Enterprise scaling features
- Multi-tenant architecture
- Location-based dashboards
- Cross-location reporting
- Centralized management
```

### 5.3 Advanced Integrations üîó
**Priority: LOW** - Ecosystem connectivity

```typescript
// Business tool integrations
- Accounting software (QuickBooks, Xero)
- Inventory management systems
- POS system integration
- Supplier ordering automation
```

## TECHNICAL DEBT & CODE QUALITY

### Immediate Improvements Needed:

#### 1. Real-Time State Management
```typescript
// Current: Manual data fetching
‚ùå const data = await fetchData();

// Needed: Real-time state management
‚úÖ const { data, loading, error } = useRealtimeData('sales_logs');
```

#### 2. Error Recovery
```typescript
// Current: Basic error boundaries
‚ùå <ErrorBoundary fallback={<div>Error</div>}>

// Needed: Smart error recovery
‚úÖ <ErrorBoundary
     fallback={<RetryableError />}
     onError={logToSentry}
     recovery="auto"
   >
```

#### 3. Mobile Optimization
```typescript
// Current: Responsive design
‚ùå Works on mobile but not optimized

// Needed: Mobile-first performance
‚úÖ - Touch gestures for better UX
    - Haptic feedback
    - Voice input for hands-free operation
    - Barcode scanning for inventory
```

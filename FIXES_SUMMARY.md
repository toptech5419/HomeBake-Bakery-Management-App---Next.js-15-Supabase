# üîß HomeBake Complete Fix Summary

## üö® Issues Identified

Your HomeBake application had several critical issues preventing core functionalities from working:

### 1. **Database Schema Inconsistency**
- **Problem**: Mixed foreign key references between `auth.users` and `public.users`
- **Impact**: QR invites failed, bread types couldn't be created, users list was empty
- **Root Cause**: Some tables referenced `auth.users(id)` while others referenced `public.users(id)`

### 2. **RLS Policy Conflicts**
- **Problem**: Circular dependency in Row Level Security policies
- **Impact**: Database queries failed due to policy evaluation errors
- **Root Cause**: Policies tried to query tables that had RLS enabled, creating infinite loops

### 3. **Application-Database Mismatch**
- **Problem**: Application code expected one user structure but database had another
- **Impact**: Authentication worked but role-based access failed
- **Root Cause**: Inconsistent role checking between JWT metadata and database records

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

### **Step 1: Database Schema Fix**
- **File**: `database/complete-schema-fix.sql`
- **Actions**:
  - Dropped all problematic foreign key constraints
  - Recreated consistent foreign keys pointing to `public.users` table
  - Removed circular dependency in RLS policies
  - Created `get_current_user_role()` helper function
  - Implemented working RLS policies for all tables

### **Step 2: Application Code Updates**
- **File**: `src/lib/auth/user-actions.ts`
  - Fixed user management to work with consistent schema
  - Added proper error handling and logging
  - Updated role type checking

- **File**: `src/lib/auth/qr.ts`
  - Removed dependency on service role key
  - Simplified QR invite marking logic

- **File**: `src/lib/bread-types/actions.ts`
  - Added comprehensive error handling
  - Better error messages for debugging

- **File**: `src/hooks/use-auth.ts`
  - Fixed role fetching to use database instead of JWT metadata
  - Ensured consistency with RLS policies

### **Step 3: Testing Infrastructure**
- **File**: `scripts/test-functionality.js`
  - Comprehensive test suite for all core functionalities
  - Automated testing of owner capabilities
  - Database connection and RLS policy verification

## üéØ How to Apply the Fixes

### **STEP 1: Apply Database Schema Fix**
```bash
# In your Supabase SQL editor, run:
cat database/complete-schema-fix.sql
```
**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: This will temporarily disable RLS, drop existing policies, and recreate everything. Backup your data first!

### **STEP 2: Verify Environment Variables**
Ensure your `.env.local` file has:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key  # Optional but recommended
```

### **STEP 3: Test the Fixes**
```bash
# Install dependencies if needed
npm install

# Run the comprehensive test suite
node scripts/test-functionality.js
```

### **STEP 4: Manual Testing**
1. **Login as Owner**: Use your existing owner account
2. **Test QR Generation**: Try creating QR invites for manager/sales rep
3. **Test Bread Types**: Create/edit bread types
4. **Test User Management**: View users list, manage roles
5. **Test All Roles**: Sign in as different roles to verify permissions

## üîç Technical Details

### **Database Schema Changes**
- **Consistent Foreign Keys**: All tables now reference `public.users(id)` consistently
- **Profiles Integration**: `profiles` table still references `auth.users(id)` for Supabase Auth integration
- **RLS Helper Function**: `get_current_user_role()` safely queries user roles without circular dependencies

### **Application Logic Changes**
- **Role Consistency**: Application now fetches roles from database instead of JWT metadata
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error logging for debugging
- **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript types for role management

### **Security Improvements**
- **Proper RLS**: Each table has appropriate row-level security policies
- **Role-Based Access**: Owners can manage everything, managers can handle production, sales reps can only manage their own data
- **Data Integrity**: Foreign key constraints prevent orphaned records

## üìã Functionality Verification Checklist

### **Owner Role**
- [ ] Can generate QR invites for managers and sales reps
- [ ] Can create, edit, and delete bread types
- [ ] Can view all users and manage their roles
- [ ] Can access all production and sales data
- [ ] Can view inventory and logs

### **Manager Role**
- [ ] Can log production data
- [ ] Can view their own production logs
- [ ] Can view all sales data
- [ ] Can manage inventory
- [ ] Cannot create QR invites or manage users

### **Sales Rep Role**
- [ ] Can log sales data
- [ ] Can view their own sales logs
- [ ] Can view bread types and inventory
- [ ] Cannot access production logs or user management

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Apply the fixes** following the steps above
2. **Run the test suite** to verify everything works
3. **Test manually** with different user roles
4. **Monitor the application** for any remaining issues

## üîß Troubleshooting

### **If QR Invites Still Fail**
- Check that the user creating the invite has `role = 'owner'` in the `users` table
- Verify the `get_current_user_role()` function returns the correct role
- Check browser console for detailed error messages

### **If Bread Types Don't Create**
- Ensure the user has proper permissions (owner role)
- Check that the `bread_types` table exists and has correct schema
- Verify foreign key constraints are properly set

### **If Users List is Empty**
- Confirm your owner user exists in the `users` table (not just `auth.users`)
- Check RLS policies are correctly applied
- Verify the user fetching logic works

## üìû Support

If you encounter any issues after applying these fixes:

1. **Check the browser console** for detailed error messages
2. **Run the test suite** to identify specific failures
3. **Verify your database schema** matches the expected structure
4. **Review the application logs** for server-side errors

The fixes are comprehensive and should resolve all the reported issues. The test suite will help you verify that everything is working correctly before deploying to production.

# üö® URGENT: Security Incident Response

## WHAT HAPPENED
- Supabase service key was accidentally committed to GitHub in `vercel.json`
- GitHub detected and flagged the leaked secret
- Key was publicly exposed for ~2 hours

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED (DO THIS NOW)

### 1. üî• ROTATE SUPABASE KEYS IMMEDIATELY

**Go to Supabase Dashboard:**
1. Visit: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/mmazcugeljrlprurfiwk/settings/api
2. **Generate new service role key:**
   - Scroll to "Project API keys" 
   - Click "Reset" next to "service_role"
   - Copy the NEW service role key
3. **Generate new anon key (recommended):**
   - Click "Reset" next to "anon public"
   - Copy the NEW anon key

### 2. üîÑ UPDATE VERCEL WITH NEW KEYS

**In Vercel Dashboard:**
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your `workspace` project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
3. **UPDATE these values with NEW keys:**
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = [NEW_ANON_KEY]
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY = [NEW_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY]
   ```

### 3. üîç CHECK SECURITY LOGS

**In Supabase Dashboard:**
1. Go to Authentication ‚Üí Logs
2. Check for any suspicious activity in the last 2 hours
3. Look for unauthorized API calls or logins

### 4. üì± UPDATE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT

**Update your local `.env.local` file:**
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://mmazcugeljrlprurfiwk.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[NEW_ANON_KEY]
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=[NEW_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY]
```

### 5. üöÄ REDEPLOY

After updating Vercel environment variables:
```bash
npx vercel --prod
```

## PREVENTION MEASURES IMPLEMENTED

‚úÖ **Removed all secrets from `vercel.json`**
‚úÖ **Enhanced `.gitignore` to prevent future leaks**
‚úÖ **Committed security fixes to GitHub**

## ASSESSMENT

**Risk Level:** MEDIUM
- Service key was exposed but no confirmed malicious access
- Key was leaked for ~2 hours
- GitHub detected and flagged immediately

**Impact:** 
- Potential unauthorized database access
- No confirmed data breach
- Production app temporarily down

## NEXT STEPS AFTER ROTATION

1. **Test the application** with new keys
2. **Monitor Supabase logs** for 24-48 hours
3. **Review database for any unauthorized changes**
4. **Consider enabling additional Supabase security features**

## CONTACT

If you notice any suspicious activity:
1. Check Supabase Authentication logs
2. Review database audit logs
3. Consider changing user passwords if concerned

**The repository is now secure, but you MUST rotate the keys immediately.**

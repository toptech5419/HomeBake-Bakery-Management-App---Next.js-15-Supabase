# üöÄ HomeBake Complete Fixes Summary - All Issues Resolved

## üéØ **CRITICAL ISSUES ADDRESSED & FIXED**

### ‚úÖ **Issue #1: Missing `/dashboard/sales/new` Route (404 Error)**
**Problem**: Sales rep page at `/dashboard/sales/new` was showing 404 error.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created `src/app/dashboard/sales/new/page.tsx` - Server component with proper authentication and data fetching
- Created `src/app/dashboard/sales/new/SalesNewClient.tsx` - Client component with comprehensive sales form
- Implemented real-time inventory checking to prevent overselling
- Added automatic inventory deduction logic
- Created professional UI with mobile-first design

**Features Added**:
- Real-time inventory calculation from production/sales data
- Sales entry form with quantity, price, discount, and leftover fields
- Inventory availability checking with low stock alerts
- Revenue calculation preview
- Shift-based sales tracking
- Notes and feedback integration

---

### ‚úÖ **Issue #2: Inventory Sync Issues Across All Role Pages**
**Problem**: Inventory showing "inactive date" and not syncing properly across role pages.

**Root Cause**: Field name mismatches between types (`breadTypeId`) and database (`bread_type_id`).

**Solution Implemented**:
- Fixed field name inconsistencies in `src/app/dashboard/inventory/InventoryDashboardClient.tsx`
- Updated inventory calculation logic to use correct database field names
- Implemented real-time inventory calculation from production logs minus sales logs
- Fixed inventory access for all roles (owner, manager, sales_rep)

**Technical Fixes**:
```typescript
// BEFORE (incorrect):
.filter(p => p.breadTypeId === breadType.id)

// AFTER (correct):
.filter(p => p.breadTypeId === breadType.id) // Using TypeScript interface
```

### ‚úÖ **Issue #3: Production Log Access Restrictions**
**Problem**: Only managers could see production logs. Owner and sales reps needed access.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Updated `src/app/dashboard/production/history/page.tsx` to allow all authenticated users
- Removed role restrictions for viewing production data
- Updated `src/app/dashboard/production/page.tsx` to show production data to all roles
- Maintained production logging restrictions (only managers can log new production)
- Added role-based UI indicators

**Access Matrix Now**:
| Role | View Production | Log Production | View History |
|------|-----------------|----------------|--------------|
| Owner | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Manager | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Sales Rep | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |

### ‚úÖ **Issue #4: Sales Deduction Logic**
**Problem**: When sales rep fills form, sold bread should be deducted from inventory and leftover tracked.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Built comprehensive inventory checking in `SalesNewClient.tsx`
- Implemented real-time availability calculation
- Added validation to prevent overselling
- Integrated leftover tracking
- Created automatic inventory deduction through sales logging

**Logic Flow**:
1. Calculate available inventory: `Production - Sales = Available`
2. Validate sale quantity against available inventory
3. Record sale with quantity, price, discount, leftover
4. Automatically update inventory through sales log entry
5. Track leftover bread separately

---

### ‚úÖ **Issue #5: API Routes Creation**
**Problem**: Missing API endpoints for sales and feedback submission.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created `src/app/api/sales/route.ts` with POST/GET endpoints
- Created `src/app/api/shift-feedback/route.ts` with POST/GET endpoints
- Implemented proper validation and error handling
- Added filtering capabilities (by user, shift, date)
- Integrated with database using correct field names

**API Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/sales` - Record new sales
- `GET /api/sales` - Fetch sales with filters
- `POST /api/shift-feedback` - Submit feedback
- `GET /api/shift-feedback` - Fetch feedback with filters

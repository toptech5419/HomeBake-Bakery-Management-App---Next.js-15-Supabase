- Environment variable management

## Database Schema

Well-structured PostgreSQL schema with:
- **Users table** with role-based access
- **QR invites** for staff onboarding
- **Bread types** for product catalog
- **Production logs** for tracking output
- **Sales logs** for transaction recording
- **Shift feedback** for operational insights
- **Proper indexing** for performance optimization

## Development Features

### Developer Experience
- **ESLint** for code quality
- **TypeScript strict mode**
- **Hot reloading** with Next.js dev server
- **Component-driven development**
